changes:
  - rscadd: "Added eight new dishes to Hemophages, most of which can be either crafted via the Hemophage Food subcategory in the crafting menu, or through microwaving!"
  - rscadd: "Added the Bloodshot drink, being the new racial drink for Hemophages! It restores blood at the rate Bloody Mary used to restore blood before this update. It's also the intended way to deal with bloodloss via drinks, which means it'll also work on those that aren't full on blood! It might gross you out if you don't need it, however."
  - rscadd: "Added the Taste Suppressor reagent, which allows you to eat food you might not like by making you completely unable to taste anything. It's not a great solution, but hey, it works, even for Hemophages!"
  - balance: "Bloody Mary now restores blood at a third of its previous speed."
  - balance: "Hemophages can now only eat food and drink reagents (via ingestion) that will help their body recovering some blood volume. They now need to use the Taste Suppressor reagent to be able to eat everything else, at the cost of not really tasting anything they eat while it's in their system."
  - imageadd: "Added some new sprites for the new Hemophage food and drinks!"
